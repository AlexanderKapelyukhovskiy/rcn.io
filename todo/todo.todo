Open questions
- how to match data from USA Cycling to Bike Reg?
	- "Race Ready" does this searching bikereg and it searches each word, which is fuzzy logic and leads to errors
	- bike reg search url: https://www.bikereg.com/events/CALIFORNIA/?ns=
	-- contacted BikeReg and they promised to extend their search API with ability to search by permit:
		hopefully including permit number in their serch results
