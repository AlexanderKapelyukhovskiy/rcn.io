We were trying to analyze how racers plan their racing season. Right now there is no any good tool: 
- to look up all information about races, location and estimate driving time, 
- to compare this with their usual life events 
- to send this information to a coach
- share it with their team 
So we asked how people usually do that.

We've got 209 unique visits and 145 responses in this survey. 10 of them don't plan reces at all (and 7 people would plan their season with a good tool).

88% (127) are road racers.
The biggest group is cat 4 (37%), then cat 3 (28%), cat 2 - 19%, cat 5 - 12%, 1/Pro - 4%.

31% older then 45 yo. 24-34, 35-44, 55 yo - by 21%, under 23 - 6%.

Females are 19% only.

People plan your racing season:

82.0%| 111| For myself (just to see how my calendar is going to look like)
49.0%| 66| To let my team know 
33.0%| 45| To let my coach know (so they can create a training plan for a season)
19.0%| 25|   Because I have to, team requires me to pick at least 10 races
7.0%| 10 |    other 

48% (65) people plan their season at the beginning, 23% - when they have a chance, 19% - before each sub-season.

39% (52) plan it for several months, 26% plan it for full season, 19% - for a month.

Criteria you use to decide on your events:

number | points | criteria
-----------|------|---------
1| 7*56+6*33+5*30+3*6+2*4+4*4+1*2 |Type (RR, Crit, TT, etc) and amount of climbing
2|  |How far it away
3|  |If I liked it in the past
