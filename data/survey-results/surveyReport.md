We were trying to analyze how racers plan their racing season. Right now there is no any good tool: 
- to look up all information about races, location and estimate driving time, 
- to compare this with their usual life events 
- to send this information to a coach
- share it with their team 
So we asked how people usually do that.

52 people took part in this survey. 6 of them don't plan reces at all.

People plan your racing season:

87.0% 40 For myself, just to see how my calendar is going to look like 
56.5% 26 To let my team know what events I am going to do 
37.0% 17 To let my coach know, so they can create a training plan for a season
8.7% 4   Because I have to, team requires me to pick at least 10 races
10.9%    other: 

65.5% 30 people plan their season at the beginning, 32.6% - once a month.

41.3% plan it for full season.

Criteria you use to decide on your events:
